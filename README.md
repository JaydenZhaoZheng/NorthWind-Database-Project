# SQL Final Project: Analyzing Monthly Sales Trends in Northwind Database

## Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing monthly sales trends using the **Northwind database**. The goal was to uncover insights into sales performance, product popularity, 
and customer behavior over time. I used my **SQL skills** to extract, analyze, and present data-driven insights.

## Analysis  
Using **SQL**, I performed the following tasks:  
1. **Monthly Sales Amount**: Calculated the total sales amount for each month to identify trends and seasonal patterns.  
2. **Top-Selling Products**: Identified the top-selling products each month based on the quantity sold, highlighting product popularity.  
3. **Product Categories Comparison**: Compared total sales between different product categories monthly to understand category performance.  
4. **Customer Orders Analysis**: Analyzed the number of orders placed by each customer per month to identify loyal and high-value customers.  

## Results  
- **Sales Trends**: Identified peak sales months and seasonal fluctuations in revenue.  
- **Top Products**: Discovered consistently high-performing products and those with seasonal demand.  
- **Category Performance**: Revealed which product categories contributed most to sales each month.
